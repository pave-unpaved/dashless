# Dashless

## A (very) simple web dashboard for home servers
### built with no js (for now) and tailwindcss
<br><br>
## Notes
- the homepage is located in /dist/index.html
- use whatever web server, i've tested with caddy, that worked fine
- credit to BisBiswas for the very cool art im using as a background image
- ill probably improve theming and customisation later but for now everything is hardcoded
- if you for some reason want to join development, this mess is built with poor judgement and tailwindcss
