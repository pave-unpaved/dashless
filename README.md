## Notes
- the homepage is located in /dist/index.html
- use whatever web server, i've tested with caddy, that worked fine
- credit to [BisBiswas](https://www.deviantart.com/bisbiswas) for the [very cool art](https://www.deviantart.com/bisbiswas/art/Chasing-A-Dream-892099029) im using as a background image
- ill probably improve theming and customisation later but for now everything is hardcoded
- if you for some reason want to join development, this mess is built with poor judgement and tailwindcss
